**Introduction**

This library is built to use Yandex Disk API with PHP in object oriented way.

**Information from Yandex**

Yandex.Disk makes it possible to manage Disk resources (files and folders) using REST API HTTP requests.
The Yandex.Disk API is intended for applications that work with the files of Yandex.Disk users or store their own files and settings on Yandex.Disk.
This document describes available API calls and formats for requests and responses. To make your first call, read the section Accessing the API.
Currently, the API allows:
Getting meta information about resources.
Uploading files to a Disk and downloading them.
Creating new folders.
Copying, moving and deleting resources.
